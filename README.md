# NOVAres — Pricing & Structural Profitability Analysis

This repository contains the analytical framework and executive report developed to assess structural profitability drivers and pricing strategy dynamics within the industry under study.

The objective is to move beyond descriptive financial metrics and build a **decision-support model** that connects:

- Structural scale
- Prestige / quality indicators
- Profit generation
- Competitive persistence
- Strategic growth scenarios

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the structural determinants of profitability using:

- Panel-style aggregated data
- Regression-based structural modeling
- Residual diagnostics
- Scenario simulations (2%, 5%, 8% growth)
- Executive-oriented visualizations

The final figures generated in the notebook are designed for **direct use in executive reporting**.

## 📊 Key Analytical Components

### 1. Structural Drivers of Profit
- Portfolio size (scale effects)
- Quality / prestige metrics
- Interaction dynamics

### 2. Residual Analysis
- Model adequacy
- Strategic dispersion
- Over- and under-performance detection

### 3. Growth Scenario Simulation
- Symmetric growth stress-testing
- Market hierarchy persistence analysis
- Structural inertia assessment

---

## 📈 Core Insights

- Profitability is structurally scale-driven.
- Prestige acts as a multiplier, not a substitute for scale.
- Market leadership is persistent under symmetric growth.
- Execution differences become more relevant at higher scale.

## 🧠 Strategic Implications

### Market Leaders
- Optimize premium pricing.
- Improve yield per unit.
- Invest selectively in prestige reinforcement.

### Mid-Tier Players
- Expand scale or specialize.
- Avoid structural stagnation.

### Small Actors
- Choose niche dominance or consolidation.
- Symmetric growth alone will not alter positioning.
